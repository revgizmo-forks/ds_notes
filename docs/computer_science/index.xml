      <description>Big-O notation is used to classify the worst-case &amp;ldquo;speed&amp;rdquo; of an algorithm by looking at the order of magnitude of execution time.
From best to worst, some common Big-O&amp;rsquo;s are:
 O(1) O(log n) O(n) O(n log n) O(n2) O(n3) O(2n)  Below are some examples of a few of these.
Create Data # Create a list 100 elements long n = list(range(100)) O(1) - Constant Time-Complexity The length of n has no bearing on the number of steps required to complete the function.</description>

      <title>Selection Sort</title>

      <description>This might not be the most efficient implementation of the selection sort algorithm. However, it is the one that closely matches how the algorithm is explained:
 Pick up the first card (if this was a deck of cards). Compare the card in your hand to each other card in turn If a smaller card is found, swap the cards (so the smaller card is now in your hand). When you get to the last card, put the card in your hand into a separate pile.</description>
